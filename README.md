This project is about processing fiber photometry data from one or two brain regions simultaneously. 
It features a processing pipeline from csv files and behavioral event files to peri-event signal on each trial. 
A database of trials is built using phautom.py and it can be selectively explored using phanal.py.
Synchronization of behavioral and photometry data is achieved by matching intervals from a series of TTL pulses.
All documentation is in Fiberphotometry_Pipeline.docx
